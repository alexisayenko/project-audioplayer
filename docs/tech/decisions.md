## ADR-0001 Components, server, hosting, storage

Status: Accepted · 2026-10-12

### Components

| Component | Status | Home |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS app | built | `ios/` |
| Download server (FastAPI + yt-dlp) | built | `server/` |
| Web interface | built | `web/`, served by FastAPI (ADR-0003) |
| Data storage | built | server disk |

### Backend server is required

The phone cannot run yt-dlp. The app calls the server for `/search`,
`/download` and `/files`. ~~The server runs on an always-on machine (e.g.
`alex-hetzner`).~~ Superseded by ADR-0004: it runs on the home server
`perkunas`. Known risk: YouTube may block datacenter IPs (a home IP
avoids this).

### Network exposure: Cloudflare Tunnel (planned, not set up)

Cloudflare Workers cannot run yt-dlp. Expose the server at an HTTPS URL
with Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`), optionally behind a Cloudflare
Access service token on top of the existing `AUDIO_API_TOKEN`. This
replaces Tailscale. Concrete setup: ADR-0004.

### Storage

- Audio on server disk: `downloads/<id>.m4a`.
- One `library.json`: song records with metadata and tags (tags replace
  playlists), see [`../product/screens.md`](../product/screens.md).
- No SQLite: a few hundred songs.
- Writes are atomic (temp file + rename), single writer (the server,
  under a lock). Web and phone go through the API.
- Revisit at tens of thousands of songs or multi-user.
- Implemented in `server/app/library.py`: `library.json` and `covers/` live in `AUDIO_DATA_DIR`, audio in `AUDIO_DOWNLOAD_DIR`.

## ADR-0002 Tags replace playlists; song fields

Status: Accepted · 2026-10-12

- A song has zero or more free-form tags; a "playlist" is a tag filter.
  There is no playlist entity.
- Song fields: `artist`, `title`, optional `album`, `year`, `genre`,
  plus `source_url`, `cover`, `tags[]` and technical `id`, `duration`,
  `added_at`.
- Screens, record layout and API: [`../product/screens.md`](../product/screens.md).

## ADR-0003 Web first, served by FastAPI at play.isayenko.net

Status: Accepted · 2026-10-12

- The web interface is built first; the mobile app is deferred.
- FastAPI serves the static UI from the same origin as the API, so no
  CORS. The API stays protected by `AUDIO_API_TOKEN`.
- Domain: `play.isayenko.net`, reaching FastAPI through Cloudflare
  Tunnel (see ADR-0001). This resolves the open web-hosting question:
  FastAPI serves it, not Cloudflare Pages.
- Interim: a hello-world page is published on `play.isayenko.net` via
  Cloudflare Pages. When the real UI ships, the DNS record is repointed
  to the Tunnel and the Pages page is dropped.

## ADR-0004 Hosting on perkunas, LXC 106 `tools`

Status: Planned, not deployed · 2026-10-12 · Supersedes the "always-on
machine / `alex-hetzner`" wording in ADR-0001

- Host: home server `perkunas` (Proxmox NUC), inside the existing
  `tools` LXC 106 (Debian 13, `192.168.0.10`, privileged). No new LXC,
  no Docker.
- Run: FastAPI + yt-dlp + ffmpeg, serving `web/`, as a plain systemd
  service. Limit it to ~2 cores: perkunas CPU throttles at 100 C under
  sustained all-core load. LXC 106 also hosts Immich.
- Public access: add an ingress rule `play.isayenko.net` ->
  `http://192.168.0.10:<port>` to the existing perkunas Cloudflare
  Tunnel. `isayenko.net` DNS and registrar are at Cloudflare. At cutover
  the interim Pages CNAME `play` -> `play-76g.pages.dev` is replaced by
  the tunnel CNAME.
- Data: audio, `covers/` and `library.json` live on a ZFS dataset on
  pool-3 (e.g. `/data/music`), bind-mounted into LXC 106. Pool-3 is a
  single disk with no redundancy; acceptable because YouTube is the
  source and audio can be re-downloaded (`library.json` and `covers/`
  still need a backup).
- Tailscale is not used.
